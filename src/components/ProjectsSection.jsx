        description:
            "A fault-tolerant key-value store was implemented in Go, featuring replication and coordination through the Raft consensus algorithm as described in Stanfordâ€™s ATC 2014 paper. The system was designed to ensure consistency and reliability across distributed nodes while maintaining high availability. To enhance performance, the service was partitioned into shards, enabling data and workload distribution across replica groups and significantly improving overall database throughput.",

            "A full-stack web application was developed using the MERN stack to connect users without parking passes to those who have one, enabling shared costs through the stable matching algorithm. The platform integrates an AI-powered text recognition system that automatically extracts parking ticket information from uploaded images, improving automation and user experience. Built by a team of four using Agile development practices, the project emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and timely delivery of features.",
